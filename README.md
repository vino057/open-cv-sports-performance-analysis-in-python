# open-cv-sports-performance-analysis-in-python

Author: Vino M

📌 Overview
This project leverages Python and OpenCV to analyze sports performance through video footage. By processing video frames, the system can detect players, track movements, and compute metrics such as speed and distance covered. It's designed to assist coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts in evaluating and improving athletic performance.

⚙️ Features
Player Detection & Tracking: Identifies and monitors players across video frames.

Speed & Distance Estimation: Calculates player movement speed and distance covered.

Performance Metrics: Computes various metrics to assess player performance.

Visualization: Provides visual feedback on performance metrics overlaid on video frames.

Modular Design: Easily extendable for different sports and analysis requirements.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.7+

OpenCV

NumPy

(Any other dependencies your project requires)

📂 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/vino057/open-cv-sports-performance-analysis-in-python.git
cd open-cv-sports-performance-analysis-in-python
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Usage
Run the main analysis script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Ensure you have a video file named input_video.mp4 in the project directory or modify the script to point to your video file.

🧪 Example Output
Upon successful execution, the script will display the processed video with overlaid performance metrics and save an output video as output.mp4.

🔧 Customization
Sports Adaptation: Modify the detection and tracking algorithms to suit different sports.

Metrics Calculation: Adjust the performance metrics to focus on specific aspects of the game.

Visualization: Customize the visual overlays to highlight desired information.
